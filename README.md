## ðŸ“‘ Abstract

Tea leaf diseases pose a significant threat to crop productivity, highlighting the need for efficient and accurate detection methods. The lack of cost-effective, lightweight models for deployment on end devices limits real-time detection. This study addressed this by annotating and utilizing the previously unlabeled **Tea Sickness Dataset** for object detection and deploying fine-tuned models on mobile devices.

The **YOLO-NAS-s**, **YOLOv8n**, **YOLOv5nu**, and **SSD-MobileNetV2** models were fine-tuned using this dataset to detect diseased tea leaves, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Among them, **YOLOv5nu** achieved a maximum mAP@50 of **0.969** and an F1-score of **0.927**, demonstrating exceptional accuracy. Its lightweight architecture ensures fast inference and low resource usage, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

After the models were evaluated, the two most lightweight models were deployed on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of using high-performance and lightweight models for real-time plant disease monitoring.
